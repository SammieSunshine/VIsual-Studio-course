        <p>When I first heard Snoh Aalegra's hit, "Fool For You", it took me by surprise. In fact, I was so surprised that I cried. Everything about this song was very well thought out!</p>

        <P> On the surface, the song just comes across as a smoother, more genuine version of Usher's "You Remind Me". It's so much more than that. I urge you to give this song not just one listen, but as many as you can. There's so much more beneath the surface."</P>
